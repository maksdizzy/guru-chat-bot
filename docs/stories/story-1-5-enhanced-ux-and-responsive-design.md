# Story 1.5: Enhanced UX and Responsive Design Implementation

**Jira Key:** TKB-5
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **user**,
I want **a polished, responsive, and accessible Knowledge Base Search experience**,
so that **I can efficiently search and verify information across all devices with professional-grade usability**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Completed RAG tool infrastructure (Stories 1.1-1.4) and existing responsive design system
- Technology: shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS 4.1.13, Framer Motion 11.3.19, Next.js 15 responsive patterns
- Follows pattern: Existing mobile-first responsive design and accessibility standards
- Touch points: Tool selection UI, parameter forms, message display, source citations, error handling

**Enhancement Details:**
This story implements comprehensive UI/UX enhancements specified in the front-end specification that are missing from the current basic implementation. It transforms the Knowledge Base Search from a functional tool into a polished, professional user experience that meets modern usability and accessibility standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Progressive Disclosure & Interaction Design

1. **Advanced Parameter Forms**: Implement Simple vs Advanced parameter input variants with progressive disclosure
   - Simple: Query input only with default group ID
   - Advanced: Expandable section with group ID customization and help text
   - Smooth transitions between variants

2. **Source Citation Enhancements**: Implement sophisticated source display beyond basic Story 1.4
   - Sources collapsed by default with citation count indicator (e.g., "3 sources")
   - Expandable source cards with smooth animations
   - Search term highlighting within source text
   - Source relevance/confidence visual indicators

3. **Smart Loading States**: Progressive loading with contextual feedback
