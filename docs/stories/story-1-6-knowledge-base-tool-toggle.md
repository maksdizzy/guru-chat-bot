# Story 1.6: Knowledge Base Tool Toggle - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a **chat user**,
I want **to toggle the Telegram knowledge base tool on/off during my chat sessions**,
So that **I can control when the AI searches external knowledge sources versus using only its internal knowledge**.

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration
- **Integrates with:** Chat component (`components/chat.tsx`) and API route (`app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **Technology:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, AI SDK
- **Follows pattern:** Existing visibility selector dropdown pattern (`components/visibility-selector.tsx`)
- **Touch points:**
  - Chat header area (`components/chat-header.tsx`)
  - Tool configuration in chat API route
  - Knowledge base search tool (`lib/ai/tools/knowledge-base-search.ts`)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. Add a toggle/selector in the chat header to enable/disable the knowledge base tool
2. Toggle state persists during the chat session
3. When disabled, the knowledge base tool is excluded from the AI's available tools list

### Integration Requirements
4. Existing chat functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New toggle follows existing dropdown/button UI patterns (similar to visibility selector)
6. Integration with chat API maintains current request/response behavior

### Quality Requirements
7. Change is covered by appropriate unit tests
8. Documentation is updated if needed
9. No regression in existing chat functionality verified

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Integration Approach
Add a new dropdown selector component similar to `VisibilitySelector` in the chat header, pass the toggle state through the chat context to the API route.

### Existing Pattern Reference
Follow the `VisibilitySelector` component pattern for UI consistency and state management approach.

### Key Constraints
- Must not break existing chat sessions
- Toggle state should be passed in the chat request body similar to `selectedVisibilityType`
- Tool list filtering happens in the `streamText` configuration in route.ts:167-173

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create `ToolSelector` component following `VisibilitySelector` pattern
- [x] Add component to `ChatHeader`
- [x] Add tool selection state management hook
- [x] Update chat API request body schema to include tool preferences
- [x] Modify tool list configuration in API route based on selection
- [x] Add unit tests for new component and functionality
- [x] Test integration with existing chat flow

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risk
Toggle state not properly syncing between UI and API, causing unexpected tool availability.

### Mitigation
Use existing state management patterns (hooks) and pass state explicitly in request body.

### Rollback Plan
Remove toggle component and revert API changes - existing functionality remains intact.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Functional requirements met
- [x] Integration requirements verified
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Documentation updated if applicable

## Story Metadata
- **Type:** Brownfield Enhancement
- **Estimated Effort:** 4 hours (single session)
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Dependencies:** Stories 1.1-1.5 (Knowledge Base Infrastructure)

## Dev Agent Record

### Status
**Ready for Review**

- `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Modified to handle tool filtering
- `app/(chat)/api/chat/schema.ts` - Updated schema for tool selection

### Change Log
1. Created ToolSelector component with dropdown UI for tool selection
2. Implemented useToolSelection hook for state management
3. Integrated ToolSelector into ChatHeader component
4. Updated Chat component to pass tool selection in API requests
5. Modified API route to dynamically filter tools based on selection
6. Added proper TypeScript types for tool arrays
7. Created comprehensive unit tests for new functionality

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent adherence to existing patterns and architectural principles. The ToolSelector component properly mirrors the VisibilitySelector structure, maintaining UI consistency. The useToolSelection hook follows established state management patterns using SWR. API integration is clean with backward-compatible schema changes. TypeScript types are properly defined and exported.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `tests/unit/tool-selector.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Converted from Jest/React Testing Library to Playwright test format
  - **Why**: Ensure consistency with project's testing architecture
  - **How**: Replaced unit test mocks with integration-style Playwright tests

- **File**: `tests/unit/use-tool-selection.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Converted from Jest hooks testing to Playwright integration tests
  - **Why**: Align with project testing patterns and provide more realistic test scenarios
  - **How**: Replaced renderHook patterns with actual page interactions and API request verification

- **File**: `playwright.config.ts`
  - **Change**: Added unit test project configuration
  - **Why**: Enable running unit tests through Playwright test runner
  - **How**: Added new project with testMatch pattern for unit tests

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (New code follows existing patterns)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Files placed in appropriate directories)
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ (Tests exist but required format conversion)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All 9 acceptance criteria validated)

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Converted test files from Jest to Playwright format
[x] Added unit test project to Playwright config
[x] Moved test files to correct tests/unit/ directory
[x] Verified all acceptance criteria are met through code review
[ ] Address existing codebase linting violations (193 errors, 15 warnings)
[ ] Consider adding e2e tests for complete tool workflow
[ ] Document testing patterns for future contributors

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Tool selection is client-side state management that affects UI behavior and API tool filtering. No sensitive data handling or authentication changes involved.

### Performance Considerations

Minimal performance impact identified. Implementation uses existing SWR caching patterns for state persistence. Tool filtering occurs server-side but with negligible computational overhead. Component follows React optimization patterns with proper memoization.

### Files Modified During Review

- `tests/unit/tool-selector.test.tsx` (converted to Playwright)
- `tests/unit/use-tool-selection.test.ts` (converted to Playwright)
- `playwright.config.ts` (added unit test project)
