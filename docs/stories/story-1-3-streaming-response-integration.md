# Story 1.3: Streaming Response Integration

**Jira Key:** TKB-3
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** Medium

## User Story

As a **user**,
I want **Knowledge Base Search results to stream naturally within chat responses**,
so that **the experience feels consistent with other AI interactions**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Vercel AI SDK v5 streaming architecture and existing message rendering system
- Technology: Next.js 15 with App Router, Vercel AI SDK 5.0.26 streaming, Redis-backed resumable streams
- Follows pattern: Existing tool execution and streaming response patterns
- Touch points: `/api/chat` endpoint, streaming response handlers, message rendering components

**Enhancement Details:**
This story integrates Knowledge Base Search tool execution with the existing streaming message architecture. When users execute the Knowledge Base Search tool, results will stream progressively into the chat interface, maintaining the same user experience as other AI interactions while properly handling both the LLM-generated answer and source citations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Tool Execution Integration**: Knowledge Base Search tool executes when selected, calling the RAG API client from Story 1.1

2. **Streaming Response Flow**: RAG responses integrate seamlessly with existing Vercel AI SDK streaming architecture

3. **Progressive Rendering**: Both LLM answer and source citations render progressively during the streaming response

4. **Response Structure**: RAG tool responses maintain proper message structure and formatting within the chat flow

### Integration Requirements

5. **API Route Integration**: `/api/chat` endpoint handles Knowledge Base Search tool calls without breaking existing functionality

6. **Message Persistence**: RAG responses persist correctly in chat history and database with proper message tracking

7. **Streaming Performance**: Knowledge Base Search integration doesn't degrade existing streaming performance for other tools

8. **Error Handling**: Failed RAG requests are handled gracefully within the streaming context with appropriate user feedback

### Quality Requirements

9. **Consistent UX**: Knowledge Base Search responses feel identical to other AI tool responses in terms of streaming behavior

10. **Memory Management**: Chat session state management handles RAG responses without memory leaks or performance degradation

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Extend existing tool execution handler in `/api/chat` to support Knowledge Base Search
- Integrate RAG API calls within the streaming response flow
- Maintain existing message structure while adding RAG-specific content

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Follow existing tool execution patterns in the chat API route
- Use same streaming response handling as other tools
- Match existing error handling and message persistence patterns

**Key Constraints:**
- Must not interfere with existing streaming performance
- RAG API calls should be properly handled within streaming context
- External API errors shouldn't break the streaming flow

## Tool Execution Flow

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for RAG tool execution within streaming context
async function handleKnowledgeBaseSearch(params: KnowledgeBaseToolParams) {
  try {
    // Call RAG API client from Story 1.1
    const ragResponse = await ragClient.search({
      query: params.query,
      group_id: params.group_id || 2493387211
    });

    // Stream RAG response within existing message structure
    return {
      type: 'tool_result',
      toolName: 'knowledge_base_search',
      content: {
        answer: ragResponse.llm_answer,
        sources: ragResponse.sources
      }
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully within streaming context
    return {
      type: 'tool_error',
      toolName: 'knowledge_base_search',
      error: 'Failed to search knowledge base'
    };
  }
}
```

## Message Structure Integration

```typescript
interface RAGToolMessage {
  id: string;
  role: 'assistant';
  content: string; // LLM answer
  toolInvocations?: [{
    toolName: 'knowledge_base_search';
    args: KnowledgeBaseToolParams;
    result: {
      answer: string;
      sources: RAGSource[];
    };
  }];
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Knowledge Base Search tool executes within existing `/api/chat` endpoint
- [ ] RAG API calls integrate with Vercel AI SDK streaming architecture
- [ ] Tool responses stream progressively to the chat interface
- [ ] Message persistence works correctly for RAG responses
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages RAG API failures
- [ ] Existing streaming performance remains unaffected
- [ ] Chat session state management handles RAG responses properly
- [ ] Tool execution follows existing patterns exactly
- [ ] Memory usage doesn't increase beyond acceptable limits
- [ ] Integration tests verify streaming behavior works correctly
- [ ] Performance tests confirm no regression in existing functionality

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Streaming integration could interfere with existing chat functionality or degrade performance

**Mitigation:**
- Careful integration following existing streaming patterns exactly
- Comprehensive testing of existing streaming functionality
- Isolated error handling that doesn't affect other tool execution

**Rollback Plan:**
- Disable Knowledge Base Search tool execution in chat API
- RAG tool selection remains available but shows "temporarily unavailable" message
- All existing functionality continues to work normally

## Integration Verification

- **IV1:** Existing streaming performance for other tools remains unaffected
- **IV2:** Message history and persistence work correctly with RAG responses
- **IV3:** Chat session state management handles RAG responses without memory leaks

## Dependencies

- **Requires:**
  - Story 1.1 (RAG API Client Infrastructure) completed AND tested
  - Story 1.2 (Knowledge Base Tool Definition) completed AND fully verified
    - Tool must be registered and functional in tool selection UI
    - Parameter validation must be working correctly
    - Tool schema must be validated with AI SDK
- **Enables:** Story 1.4 (Source Citation Display Enhancement)

## Pre-Implementation Verification

Before beginning Story 1.3 implementation, verify:
1. **Tool Registration Complete**: Knowledge Base Search tool appears in tool selection UI
2. **Parameter Forms Working**: Tool parameter input forms function correctly
3. **Tool Schema Validated**: AI SDK recognizes and validates tool parameters
4. **Integration Tests Passing**: Story 1.2 integration tests demonstrate tool selection works
5. **No UI Regressions**: Existing tool functionality unaffected by new tool addition

## Estimated Effort

**Development:** 8-10 hours
**Testing:** 4-5 hours
**Total:** 12-15 hours

## Performance Considerations

- RAG API calls should have appropriate timeout handling (from Story 1.1)
- External API failures shouldn't block the streaming response
- Memory usage for source citations should be monitored
- Response caching may be considered for frequently accessed knowledge

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for tool execution handler
- Integration tests for streaming response flow
- Performance tests to ensure no regression
- Error scenario testing for RAG API failures
- Load testing to verify streaming performance under RAG usage
